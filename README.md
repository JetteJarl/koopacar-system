# Autonomous Driving Turtlebot3 using ROS2 Foxy
This repository contains the implementation of a self-driving Turtlebot3. The system was initially developed as a prototype for the RUB Motorsports racecar taking part in the Student Formula competition. The system layout and most important design decisions are being documented below.

## Layout
The complete cluster of nodes and their interaction can be seen in the following overview.

The KoopaCar was first developed in a university course. In addition to holio00 and JetteJarl, NilsB98 and Morten Terhart were also part of that group of students.
